# Agent Instructions

Use `CONTRIBUTING.md` as the canonical guide for contributor workflow:

- environment setup
- dependency installation
- local client/server run instructions
- required test commands before submitting changes

If a workflow detail conflicts with other docs, follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution tasks.
